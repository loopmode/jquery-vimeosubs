1
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,120
For me, the most important question today

2
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,600
is how to sit together and to discuss,

3
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,320
not one or two persons,

4
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,040
but to see if it’s possible

5
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,760
for all of us on this planet

6
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,320
to start to raise the questions about what’s important.

7
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,600
For me, what’s important…

8
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,200
Are you bending the truth of climate change?

9
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,360
Why are African states less developed than Western states?

10
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,760
What is the proper balance between Jewish values

11
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,000
and other values in a democracy?

12
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,360
Why do they dislike Americans?

13
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,520
How does an individual relate to the group in the 21st Century?

14
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,680
This place has a lot of history.

15
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,880
In this place, as you know, 

16
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,040
they used to burn books

17
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,760
of people who speak things 

18
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,200
that other people don’t like to know.

19
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,200
And maybe that’s why we come here

20
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,480
to August-Bebelplatz in the middle of Berlin,

21
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,600
where books got burned.

22
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,200
The thoughts got burned.

23
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,200
The freedom of speech got burned here!

24
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,520
It’s wonderful to see

25
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,920
all the beautiful faces around this table.

26
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,240
We have a long day ahead of us,

27
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
so we’re going to go right into the program.

28
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,840
Today, we ask and we begin 

29
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,080
to discover answers to 100 questions 

30
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,360
chosen from thousands, donated by

31
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,000
people from all around the world.

32
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,640
We will ask them all over the course

33
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,400
of the next nine hours…

34
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,000
OK, so turn the camera a bit straight...

35
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,280
Thank you.

36
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Not so much. A little bit… There! Thank you.

37
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,040
Together we come together, as one,

38
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,120
to celebrate our diversity

39
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,800
and to gather a multiplicity of viewpoints.

40
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,080
Thank you for being here with us

41
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
at the Table of Free Voices.

42
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,880
Question One

43
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,720
from Anonymous, USA.

44
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,040
What is today’s most important unreported story?

45
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,640
You can start with your answer.

46
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,000
What ought to be reported today 

47
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,000
and definitely does not 

48
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,040
is how much life costs...  

49
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,040
the price of life on this planet.

50
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,800
We are going from crisis to crisis

51
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,960
and we only report a portion of the story.

52
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,920
When the guns of battle are silenced,

53
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,440
we then forget about that country,

54
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,280
that region that has suffered conflict,

55
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,800
and we go to report a different story.

56
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,240
Well, I would begin with Darfur,

57
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,800
the annihilation

58
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,600
of populations

59
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,280
just because they have another religion

60
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,560
or are of another race.

61
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,040
And the world is not interested in them

62
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,840
because they

63
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,760
have no resources.

64
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,840
No oil.

65
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,480
For me, the most unreported story of today

66
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,760
is the truth behind the global terrorism.

67
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,880
We have no idea, really no idea,

68
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,000
what is the truth behind it.

69
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Who is alive? Who is dead?

70
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,360
Who is advancing it? Who is pioneering it?

71
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,000
Who is making use of it

72
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,520
in "his" or "their" favor.

73
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,920
The children who

74
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,920
has been slaved

75
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,600
Human traffics.

76
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,840
The millions and millions of people

77
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,560
crossing borders illegally

78
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,800
in search for a better life.

79
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,760
I think today’s most important unreported story

80
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,360
is the story of the young girl who died

81
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,040
ten minutes ago of malaria.

82
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,880
She died needlessly,

83
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,680
because the drugs 

84
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,640
that would be able to kill the malaria parasite exist 

85
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,000
and are cheap.

86
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,080
But she didn’t get those drugs.

87
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,720
And she died,

88
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,080
and just now another child died,

89
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,760
and this story goes unreported.

90
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,640
I don’t think there is 

91
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,480
today’s one most important 

92
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,120
unreported story. There are many 

93
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,280
unreported stories throughout the world.

94
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,520
It’s the good things that are happening in the world.

95
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,360
We don’t hear about the good things that are happening.

96
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,080
There are such wonderful things happening out there.

97
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,040
All we ever hear about it is the bad news:

98
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,680
the death, the destruction, wars,

99
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,160
killing, murder, rapes.

100
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,520
Problems.

101
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,920
If you squeeze a newspaper,

102
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,120
it seems like it bleeds.

103
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,360
Thank you

104
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,800
Question Twelve from Judy Twedt,

105
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,920
24, Denver, USA…

106
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,560
Should we have the right to choose where we live?

107
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,000
Now, that’s an interesting question.

108
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,000
I like it!

109
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,800
We are just born.

110
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,840
We're just born somewhere on planet Earth

111
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,000
and if we don’t want to stay there

112
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,840
we go somewhere else.

113
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,920
But then, when we go somewhere else,

114
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,520
we're discriminated against.

115
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,280
I arrived two days ago

116
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,840
and on the 11th I must leave again

117
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,120
because my visa lasts for only four days.

118
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,400
As a Colombian,

119
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,200
as a citizen of the world,

120
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,200
I have no right to enter this paradise,

121
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,360
the paradise of the First World,

122
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,360
except for four days.

123
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,120
Well, I believe, of course,

124
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,200
we should have the right to choose where we live.

125
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,880
I mean, we live in a world where capital can move,

126
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,320
where goods can move, 

127
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,840
and I don’t understand why there is

128
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,160
so much hysteria about people moving.

129
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,520
For example, one time I wanted to go to Dubai

130
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,520
but, because I have a 

131
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,600
1951 Geneva Convention passport, I was not allowed. 

132
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,560
And the reason for this, they told me,

133
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,560
was because I didn’t belong anyway. 

134
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,680
Everybody wishes to live in a place that is free of war.

135
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,440
Everybody wishes to live a harmonious existence

136
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,240
but some people can buy that and others cannot. 

137
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,960
Some people can lay claim to that right 

138
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,040
and others are just not in a position to do so. 

139
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,080
Yes, we all of us should have the right to live wherever we want,

140
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,120
but all of us should be able to afford to do so.

141
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,520
Sometimes you have to move to be able to support your family

142
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,560
Now, if you’re crossing borders

143
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,640
and you are not recognized by their state,

144
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
does that mean you’re illegal?

145
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,000
By definitions of the state. But I don’t think that, as humans,

146
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,560
we can really say another human is illegal.

147
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,720
And the people who are moving are mostly doing so

148
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,400
because they are desperate. They’re taking enormous risks

149
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,760
Look at the people who are arriving in the Canary Islands

150
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,080
every week in makeshift boats, 

151
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,440
and they’re arriving on the beach by the hundreds.

152
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,480
These people are absolutely desperate.

153
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,560
Otherwise they would not have left.

154
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,920
That’s not a fair choice.

155
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,520
That’s not saying I’m going to choose where I’m going to live.

156
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,760
You’re not going to choose to risk 

157
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,120
nine chances out of ten of drowning 

158
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,360
or being killed before you actually arrive.

159
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,880
That´s not a choice!

160
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,600
You could also ask the question,

161
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,720
shouldn’t we have the right to remain where we are?

162
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,360
This is a very urgent question 

163
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,880
for many, many people on this Earth.

164
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,200
Like Tibetan people, like myself as a Tibetan,

165
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,680
we don’t have this right.

166
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,440
Yes, we can live in our country

167
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,280
but we can’t necessarily do what we want to.

168
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,800
The day the law

169
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,400
has effectively realized the possibility

170
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,400
of granting this right without restriction to all people,

171
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,560
on that day humanity will have done more

172
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,960
than pass over a boundary.

173
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,320
It will have attained a degree of evolution

174
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:14,040
fully to be desired by all cultures and nations.

175
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,920
It’s important 

176
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,280
we can live where we want to. 

177
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,000
And everyone, I think, it’s important their nests.

178
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,200
Even the birds need their nests.

179
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,920
Human beings need their homes.

180
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,320
Question Nineteen, from Claire Mackintosh, 

181
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,800
25, Brisbane, Australia…

182
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,440
What are the basic dignities that each human being deserves

183
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,040
and why do we let so many people go without them?

184
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,040
The basic dignity is human dignity, 

185
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,560
their pride, so they can have their head up, not head down.

186
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,720
They don’t have to be scared of anything!

187
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,960
Maybe they are living in a remote village

188
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,480
in some part of a developing country. So what?

189
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,680
They should be standing straight...

190
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,960
We let so many people go without them

191
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,320
so we can let other people do what they do.

192
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,280
Take lands. 

193
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,120
Drop bombs. 

194
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,840
Take water. 

195
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,440
Control minds.

196
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,800
All for ourselves and nothing for other people

197
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,960
seems to have been, in every age of the world,

198
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,360
the vile maxim of the masters of mankind.’

199
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,800
All for ourselves and nothing for other people.

200
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,320
It’s Adam Smith who said that, 

201
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,920
Adam Smith, the father of capitalism.

202
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,440
He knew that that was the tendency.

203
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,320
All for ourselves and nothing for other people!

204
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,560
Indeed, I think that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

205
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:49,280
is what should be available for people throughout the world.

206
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,040
We should not accept 

207
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,880
that anyone is denied those basic human rights,

208
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,520
the basic human right to live a decent life,

209
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:08,320
to have access to food, shelter and education.

210
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,080
It is Inacceptable that in today’s world

211
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,520
there are children who are dying of hunger.

212
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,240
It is Inacceptable that in today’s world

213
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,720
there are children who have no shelter…

214
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,120
To prepare myself for this question,

215
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,920
I went onto the Internet, wikipedia, 

216
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,160
and I re-read the United Nations Universal

217
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,240
Declaration of Human Rights

218
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,280
and it made me cry. 

219
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,760
I just wept. It is so beautiful.

220
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,440
Let’s put it in every passport!

221
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,440
My father was exterminated at the age of 37, 

222
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,160
my mother at the same age.

223
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,560
My sisters were exterminated at the age of twelve and sixteen.

224
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,480
I survived, and life has become very precious for me

225
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,960
and I assume that it is also precious

226
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,280
for every human being on this on this planet. 

227
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,640
And yet it is often taken away, 

228
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,120
for wrong reasons…

229
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,440
We teach our children that our lives are worth more than

230
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,240
other people’s lives, outsiders, people...

231
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,320
with a different color skin than ours,

232
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,280
people that have less than we do,

233
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,280
people that don’t speak the language that we do.

234
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,600
People...

235
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,920
The other. The other people.

236
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,680
What happens oftentimes is that those people

237
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,240
are really seen as them and not us,

238
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,680
and there’s not much attention paid to or much concern for

239
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,240
the basic rights and dignities of those people.

240
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,640
But I think you have to think about

241
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,640
what ‘we’ means in this question. 

242
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,600
Who are ‘we’ and who are ‘they’?

243
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,880
A baby, when they cry, you cannot distinguish

244
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,320
if it’s a boy, a girl, what nationality,

245
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,160
what religion is the religion of the mother?

246
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,400
It’s only one voice. 

247
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,240
Don’t forget this! It’s only one sound.

248
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,000
We must remember this.

249
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,080
I guess if people really saw each other as their brother

250
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,280
and really could imagine that each person out there 

251
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,120
was their child or their relative, it would be really different,

252
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,840
if we could really open our hearts that wide.

253
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,160
Everyone can gain human dignity for themselves.

254
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,000
Before this, though, one must leave behind

255
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,640
the self-imposed oppression

256
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,240
of politics, ideology, religion

257
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,480
and nationalistic narrow-mindedness.

258
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,480
I come…

259
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,440
I come from the jungle

260
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,280
where I lived for the most part of my life with tribes

261
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,440
and where

262
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,200
the question of freedom

263
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,360
is much more meaningful than it is here.

264
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,360
I have never known more free beings than them,

265
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,400
the indigenous people.

266
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,400
No, I never have.

267
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,920
Do you believe this project can move something?

268
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,880
I knew it

269
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,040
from the moment that this murmur first began,

270
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,320
and this babble.

271
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,920
It sent a shiver down my spine

272
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,920
and I realized that something will come of this,

273
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,400
that it's helping.

274
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,640
I was reminded a little of 'Wings of Desire'.

275
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,840
There are these angels hearing all these voices.

276
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,720
There's this similar kind of murmur the whole time.

277
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,720
And then this murmur was here, only it was real.

278
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,520
All these people really were thinking aloud.

279
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,720
Oh, hey! Did you see Bianca?

280
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,560
I think she’s over there.

281
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,560
There she is! 

282
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,360
I think she showed up late.

283
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,880
If you can do me a big favor?

284
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,040
Don’t move it when I’m talking because that immediately…

285
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,240
You know, if you can do it before 

286
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,400
or after or when I stop talking, 

287
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,280
because if you do it when I do, my concentration…

288
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,240
I do it when I get the notes from the others…

289
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,320
Question Twenty-Eight from Andrew,

290
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,640
22, Frankfurt, Germany…

291
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,240
What if all Chinese people want a car?

292
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,920
This question is a bit racist.

293
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,400
Why not? 

294
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,880
Everybody needs a car.

295
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,360
Why do you talk only about the Chinese

296
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,600
and when you go to America,

297
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,360
there every family has more than three cars?

298
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,360
Why Chinese? Everybody wants a car. Everybody.

299
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,840
I mean, there are a lot of Italian, French and German people

300
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,720
who don’t have a car and they want a car. 

301
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,440
What if all Indians want a car?

302
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,360
What if all Africans want a car?

303
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,200
If all Chinese people want to have a car,

304
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,240
assuming that they would want to drive

305
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,720
the most powerful, the biggest and the fastest cars,

306
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,400
then the skies above us would darken.

307
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,560
Not enough roads, many accidents,

308
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,160
not enough car parking space,

309
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,160
too much pollution.

310
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,600
What if all Chinese people want a car?

311
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,560
Then all German people

312
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,200
must be turned into automobile workers

313
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,440
to produce cars for the Chinese

314
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,360
until all the Germans are exhausted.

315
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,400
It's an impossible story.

316
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,360
The car of today in the wealthy world

317
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,000
utilizes 2-3% of the energy in the gas tank

318
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,120
to actually move the driver.

319
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,440
The rest is lost in moving the weight of the frame

320
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,240
and the weight of the engine,  

321
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,320
lost in heat and friction. 

322
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,560
We’ve devised an enormously sophisticated set

323
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,600
of very badly designed vehicles

324
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,800
just to move one person from one place to another.

325
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,800
Petroleum prices will continue 

326
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,560
their sharp upward movement 

327
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,400
and economic chaos in the West at the most 

328
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,120
or, at the very least, the grim, inevitable realization that

329
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,760
something has to be done about 

330
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,480
the excess consumption of these fossil fuels 

331
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,160
in the United States of America

332
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,800
and other Western countries

333
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,000
is going to be impressed upon people’s consciousness.

334
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,320
China, for a long time, 

335
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,480
was a nation of bicycles. 

336
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,720
I’m encouraged that Chinese automakers are 

337
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,560
looking at the ecological impacts of the cars 

338
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,480
and working very hard and thinking about electric cars.

339
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,480
China has a huge opportunity 

340
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,880
and a huge responsibility 

341
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,080
to industrialize in a way that 

342
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,640
works for its people 

343
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,160
and for its environment

344
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,000
and for the world.

345
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,480
It’s clear that what is behind the question

346
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,280
is not so much the Chinese people, but

347
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,200
a metaphor for

348
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,200
a situation in which it’s unsustainable, clearly.

349
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,800
We cannot ask of them 

350
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,800
what we’re not prepared to do ourselves!

351
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,840
And what we need to do is 

352
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,120
we should learn from our mistakes,

353
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,200
from the way we have lived, 

354
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,280
from the irrational and the irresponsible way

355
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,720
in which we have lived our life.

356
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,840
The problem is not how many people want a car

357
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,680
but that the door to human desires

358
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,160
has been opened interminably.

359
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,480
How can we close the door again

360
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,200
after opening it to our infinite, possessive desires?

361
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,360
Everything OK? 

362
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,480
It’s OK. It’s OK…

363
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,520
How you doing?

364
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,360
Ah good. A little bit exhausted.

365
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,160
Hey. Wow! Ow! Ow! That’s too much?

366
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,920
Yeah!

367
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,960
This is just so cool to be here doing this.

368
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,520
Is it?

369
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,840
Yeah, this is where the Nazis burned the books.

370
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,520
Oh, now I get it. That stack of books is there because of that.

371
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,720
Jesus, I didn’t realize that…

372
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,920
Willem. Hey!

373
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,960
Hey, how many questions do you have now?

374
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,920
After all these! You want to know…? So many questions…

375
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,680
I'm speaking…

376
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,240
I'm speaking so much

377
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,840
about all the problems.

378
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,920
I'm setting it all on fire!

379
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,000
Am I doing OK?

380
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,680
Question Thirty-Three is from

381
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:59,560
the New York-based novelist, Siri Hustvedt, who asks…

382
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,240
I’m very curious to know, to find out 

383
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,440
how consumer culture actually influences  

384
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,000
the personalities, the ways people live, 

385
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,160
the way they think, 

386
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,800
inside themselves, in a given culture…

387
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,680
how it becomes part of us, 

388
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,640
and what it means to be able to resist

389
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,800
that visual and verbal culture....

390
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,720
it seems to me, is alway reducing 

391
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,800
and simplifying reality into something

392
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,960
that can be easily bought and sold?

393
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,080
I think...

394
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,120
Consumer...consumer culture...

395
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,920
It functions to keep creating 

396
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,480
a desire in the society, in the community, 

397
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,000
that here is something new, here is something better,

398
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,720
here is something more…

399
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,200
Man needs nothing. 

400
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,000
He needs only himself.

401
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,440
He needs love.

402
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,440
There are enough coffee pots in the world.

403
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,240
There are enough gadgets surrounding us.

404
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,880
There are enough chairs!

405
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,440
Use one of the many hundreds that are already there

406
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,160
and then put your extra energy into developing

407
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,000
those things that really matter.

408
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,800
All this forms part of a culture of prostitution.

409
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,720
Our values have become prostituted

410
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,520
and humanity itself just a big prostitution machine.

411
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,360
We created monsters…

412
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,720
monsters of agricultural development.

413
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,400
McDonald’s cows are killed

414
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,120
and there’s no ceremony of killing the animal. 

415
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,120
There’s no honoring, thanking the animal

416
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,840
for providing the food for us.

417
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,680
So when there’s no ceremony, the food we eat becomes bad.

418
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,000
And guess what? 

419
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,000
Where McDonald’s is eaten, people become sick.

420
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,720
What did you expect? There’s no ceremony!

421
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,800
The most powerful people on the face of the planet

422
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,120
are the ones who can affect the most minds,

423
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:47,880
who can influence human behavior and social movements,

424
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,600
and the way in which societies view themselves, 

425
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,200
see themselves,

426
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,800
the way they walk, the way they talk, 

427
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,360
things they eat, they drink and such like.

428
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,480
And it’s all a matter of economics.

429
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,000
It's a model

430
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,000
that is destroying us.

431
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,760
It's a model that is consuming us.

432
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,440
What we really need to look at 

433
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,240
is the free market itself 

434
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:23,040
and see how we can really bring in the whole aspect of ethics.

435
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,600
Wealth in order to share, to care,

436
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,320
and to live happily with oneself and others.

437
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,880
And the deepest, the best wealth is how to serve others.

438
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,520
Question Thirty-Seven is from

439
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,960
Tom Henze, 30, Berlin, Germany…

440
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:55,960
Does our wealth depend on the Third World being poor?

441
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,320
The expression 'Third World' is truly an arrogant claim.

442
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,440
It is not a Third World but it is also a world

443
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,720
that has developed in a different way

444
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,080
or that has stood back from development.

445
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,760
But it is not the Third World.

446
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,840
What then would the First World be?

447
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,480
What is that definition of the Third World anyway?

448
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,840
Is there a First World, a Second World and a Third World?

449
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,960
Not really.

450
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,080
One world? 

451
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,960
Not doing so well? Humans fucking it up?

452
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:37,600
I mean, if our wealth depends on the Third World being poor,

453
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,120
then we’re in trouble, 

454
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,600
we’re in trouble…

455
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,160
They started first by taking the gold away. 

456
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,800
But gold for indigenous people 

457
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,480
didn’t have the same value as it did for capitalists.

458
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,800
Africa has been the cradle of mankind

459
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,760
and I stand very clearly and say that Africa

460
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,120
is also going to be the deathbed of capitalism.

461
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,920
Oh plundered Africa… 

462
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,360
Africa, terrible Africa. 

463
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,120
It's impossible to talk about Africa without feeling… 

464
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,280
without feeling our hearts twinge.

465
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,600
Those who are well fed never understand

466
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,760
what it feels like to be hungry.

467
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
A Nigerian chief once said:

468
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,480
‘If you will not share your wealth with us, 

469
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,600
we will share our poverty with you.’

470
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,840
So if you want global peace we have to talk about 

471
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,800
equitable distribution.

472
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,360
We also have to understand

473
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,200
that all of the resources

474
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,120
are shared by all

475
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,400
and they are first of all for those in need.

476
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,000
Real property is property by need.

477
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,080
It comes about through need.

478
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,920
When I need a glass of water, then it is mine

479
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,240
by right of need.

480
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,200
Fair! ‘Fair’ is not a word that you hear

481
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,360
in economics too much.

482
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,880
There is a connection that we have to make

483
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,520
as to the poverty of the people, 

484
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,680
the wealth of the land, and be observant as to 

485
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,400
where this wealth is going.

486
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,600
What I believe globalization is really about is 

487
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,280
forming global family, moving out of what I call

488
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,880
a juvenile species mode of hostile competition

489
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,920
and into a more mature mode of cooperation.

490
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,680
This has happened to many species all through evolution

491
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,760
and it’s our turn now as humans to do this.

492
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,800
I make it very simple. One is...

493
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,080
joining in the generosity of the divine, 

494
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,080
which is a power of giving. All life is given to us.

495
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,760
And those who do that are ‘for giving’.

496
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,240
And then, if your life is centered around getting, 

497
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,480
then you’re joining in the culture of ‘for getting'.

498
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:21,080
So the choice is to be part of ‘for getting’ and being forgotten

499
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,400
or part of ‘for giving’ and being forgiven.  

500
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,880
I like that!

501
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,640
That’s great.

502
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,000
He said it for me, my neighbor - Repeat. Repeat.

503
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,200
Yes. Can you come and sit in my seat and say it for me?

504
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,320
I would like it if we had more interaction in this process.

505
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,320
I’m enlivened by sharing with somebody.

506
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,400
My brain doesn’t, my brain doesn’t… 

507
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,680
I mean, this! Talking to you… 

508
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,880
Talking to you!

509
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,280
Hi sweetheart. Hi! How are you?

510
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,600
Are you having fun, baby?

511
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,360
Are you having fun? - Yeah.

512
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,440
Because you’re so smart. You’re such a genius.

513
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,560
Answers just roll off your tongue.

514
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,880
I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know!

515
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,480
I guess we’re part of a big experiment. 

516
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,920
You know, it’s not about the questions. This is about us.

517
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,840
They’re doing something to us here.

518
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,760
Go ahead.

519
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,520
Thank you.

520
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,280
While you were giving your answers to that last question,

521
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,520
I was walking through the circle

522
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,520
and I was able to see all your faces, hear your voices,  

523
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,760
see your expressions.

524
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,880
And it was deeply moving for me to see 

525
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,600
everything that I saw as I walked through the circle. 

526
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,400
It’s such a diverse group that we have here. 

527
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,720
We’re our own United Nations! 

528
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,000
 I saw people from Africa, from Asia, Australia, 

529
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,760
from Europe and the Americas. 

530
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,160
And it’s beautiful that we’re all together here  

531
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,840
investing in the future.

532
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,440
Question Forty-One 

533
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:21,280
from Adrienn Meszaros, 30, Budapest, Hungary…

534
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,760
Is there a modern version of colonialism?

535
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,520
Yes. 

536
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,720
Yes, there is a modern version of colonialism, and it’s got a name. 

537
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,360
It’s called debt.

538
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,920
It is called debt, followed by the structural adjustment policies

539
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,320
imposed by the World Bank 

540
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,360
and the International Monetary Fund.

541
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,640
A lot of this money coming to developing countries

542
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,320
is actually used to control the sovereignty of our own governments,

543
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,920
of our own people…

544
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,280
The Bank and the Fund move in and they say,

545
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,800
‘OK, if you’re going to pay back your debt 

546
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,960
and you must pay back your debt',

547
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,800
then you have to put interest rates way, way up...

548
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,000
That makes it harder for businesses 

549
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,560
to borrow and to employ people.

550
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,840
You’ve got to privatize everything in sight,

551
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,520
so that gives big opportunities 

552
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,600
to foreign companies and local elites

553
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,600
to buy up all of the previously public companies.

554
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:25,720
The United States of America was itself built

555
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,920
on the decimation of an entire people.

556
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:37,320
Europe has been built on sucking out the Congo,

557
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,040
on sucking out the gold and diamonds of South Africa.

558
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,760
Slavery was about the exploitation of raw materials.

559
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,120
Today it's about oil. 

560
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,720
Today it's about diamonds. 

561
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,000
Today it's about all the minerals and primary resources.

562
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,320
The countries… 

563
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,520
the Latin American countries 

564
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,320
continue to suffer exploitation, the

565
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,240
exploitation of their resources.

566
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,720
All of these policies have been very beneficial

567
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,480
to a tiny minority of the people in these countries.

568
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,280
Just like vampires. They are vampires! 

569
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,160
They use the energy, the strength and the lives of others 

570
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,000
for their own economic prosperity.

571
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,200
It’s modern economic colonialism based on globalization,

572
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,960
but its structure is almost exactly the same

573
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,680
as it has been for four or five hundred years.

574
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,880
It’s better than colonialism because it doesn’t need an army.

575
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,800
It doesn’t need an administration.

576
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,720
It doesn’t cost you anything as the person intervening,

577
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,520
the state, the powers intervening…

578
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,200
'We are children of a world that

579
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,000
has enough for everyone. 

580
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,720
But so many remain hungry while so few are well fed. 

581
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,120
One will eat, the other suffer.

582
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,200
This is how it's always been.   

583
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,160
Other nations must be poor so that rich ones can be rich.'

584
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,320
And this is a really ideal system because

585
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,560
it isn’t even very visible.  

586
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,960
Colonialism is visible. 

587
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,600
People think this is rotten. There’s pictures taken.  

588
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,560
But debt is invisible,

589
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,320
and it works just as well, even more efficiently.

590
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:27,160
I don’t like to be sitting here as an American talking about this,

591
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,840
but this is the underbelly of the real world that we live in.

592
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:37,480
It’s very real. It has caused enormous misery, 

593
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,640
and we have to know what’s going on in our world 

594
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,520
in order to change it.

595
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:46,200
There must be some democratic forms of life 

596
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,880
and forms of organization

597
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,320
that can sidestep all imperial 

598
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,240
and colonial forms of subjugation.

599
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,120
That’s the great question of the 21st Century!

600
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,520
Question Forty-Five from Katharina, 24, Germany…

601
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:27,680
Why do we still believe more in nationality than in humanity?

602
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,600
It is by the conditioning of mind that we are

603
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,800
trained, trained, trained all the time,

604
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,240
that we are part of a national identity. 

605
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,840
That is how we see it.

606
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,680
And, within a nation, again it gets down 

607
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,800
to smaller and smaller and smaller identities…

608
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,160
And so we’re fearful. 

609
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:01,400
We have been put into a framework to protect ourselves. 

610
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,160
We’re so insecure.

611
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,440
We do not know who is for us and who is not for us 

612
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,800
and that has destroyed humanity.

613
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,400
Let me give you an example.

614
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,120
In Iraq now

615
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,640
my country Iraq,

616
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,000
most people cling to

617
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,200
and trust

618
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,560
only their own people

619
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,920
or their neighbors or others from their city.

620
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,200
Before, we did not ask who a person was,

621
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,640
where they came from,

622
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,080
from which city,

623
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,360
from which tribe or family.

624
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,720
We would be friendly, that's all. 

625
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,600
It is security, psychological security,

626
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,760
that enables people to feel an expanded sense of self,

627
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,600
that enables them to respect difference.

628
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,440
It is when people feel frightened, scared, cut off,

629
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,360
that intolerance grows,

630
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,160
and in the nation states today people are being manipulated

631
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,160
through the mass media

632
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,200
to learn to hate the other whom they have never met.

633
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,560
We live in a world where we have been conditioned to be tribal,

634
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,400
to be nativist, 

635
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,320
to be nationalist. 

636
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,600
Of course, it’s important to understand 

637
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,600
that nationalism is really fanaticism.

638
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,040
I believe that within each of us

639
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,960
there is a racist dictator.

640
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,640
I’m convinced of this.

641
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,280
Because to us the family is closer

642
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,880
than the clan,

643
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,320
the clan is closer than the tribe,

644
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,760
the tribe is closer than the nation,

645
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,720
the nation is closer than humanity.

646
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,960
I, for one, don’t believe in nationality at all

647
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,280
and I think more and more of us in the 21st Century,

648
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,080
children of the world of possibility,

649
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,040
children of the future tense perhaps,

650
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,120
live in the passageways between nations, 

651
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,640
between cultures and between categories

652
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,360
outside the traditional definitions, 

653
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,080
and our affiliations are not to nations 

654
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,120
or to the traditional order but to something beyond that.

655
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,880
I believe that, to a certain extent,

656
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,920
the concept of nationality is beginning to erode

657
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:41,640
as we turn into a kind of genuinely transnational people.

658
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,240
Sometimes the worst enemy

659
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,200
is our own perception.

660
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,160
Thank you.

661
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,680
Question Forty-Eight from Glen, Cape Town, South Africa...

662
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,200
How do we stop our governments from going to war?

663
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,920
I come from the land where there has never been any war,

664
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,440
so I do not know anything about war

665
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,960
but I do know the suffering you people have experienced.

666
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,720
Me? I come from the land of peace,

667
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,720
Where nothing but peace has been in existence,

668
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,200
where no one is fearing being shot,

669
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,840
where no one is aiming at you, 

670
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,200
where no one fights for the land.

671
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,920
We go to war: you, me, us.

672
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,920
Governments don’t go to war. 

673
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,520
Governments send us to war. 

674
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,040
We pay the price, 

675
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,240
and the price that we pay is not only physical. 

676
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,320
The price that we pay is psychic. 

677
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,920
We lose our moral groundedness.

678
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,640
We lose ourselves.

679
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,440
It’s really a shame. 

680
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,040
The big powers should be ashamed 

681
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,920
of what they are doing with the civilization. 

682
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,400
Killing them?

683
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,720
I’m a survivor of war in Bosnia and,

684
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,760
for three and a half years of my childhood,

685
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:22,480
millions of bombs exploded in my city.

686
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,200
And to hear a bomb explode is an experience

687
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,400
that can’t be explained or described 

688
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,760
because you feel it in your body.

689
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,240
I remember, just my whole body reacting

690
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,680
to such loudness and destruction,

691
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,240
and my heart would jump every time, millions of times,

692
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,640
and there were times when it felt like 

693
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,080
my heart could no longer take it

694
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,880
and it would just burst into millions of pieces.

695
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,200
…we human beings are nothing but collateral damage.

696
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,000
We’re not talking about numbers. 

697
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,840
We’re not talking about lives destroyed.

698
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,280
We’re not talking about families destroyed,

699
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,120
but we’re basically talking about collateral damage. 

700
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,000
It’s just numbing.

701
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,200
Because we’re not seeing a face. It is distant!

702
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,720
The political process has lost touch with the reality,

703
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,360
the fact that war is only about economics.

704
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,160
It is incomprehensible how, day after day,

705
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,320
the world powers can spend so much money 

706
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,160
on death.

707
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,240
We’ve lost our connection to 

708
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,640
our responsibility for what our governments do. 

709
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,720
And we get lost in our powerlessness, 

710
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,560
and we think we can change it in a few moments.

711
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,360
You know, people marched against the war and it didn’t work

712
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,320
and so everyone goes home and starts to live their lives again,

713
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,120
while what they were in the streets about originally has become

714
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,560
a greater nightmare than they could have ever imagined.

715
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,080
But why was it horrible when they first entered the streets

716
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,240
and not so horrible now that no one’s in the streets?

717
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,760
How you stop the government is a very difficult question.

718
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,840
The only way, I think, one could do it 

719
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,800
is by overthrowing that government, 

720
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,280
by a revolution!

721
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,120
But then, of course, the notion of revolution in our time is 

722
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,680
so archaic, so dépassé. 

723
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,640
We don’t think in those terms anymore, 

724
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,720
but that is the only way we stop a government.

725
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,600
The most important step

726
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,160
that all the women of the world can take

727
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,160
is not to give their children away

728
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
to be turned into soldiers,

729
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,080
to be turned into killers.

730
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,200
I come from a region

731
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,440
where we all started to hate each other

732
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,080
and to kill each other savagely

733
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,880
as if the others were no longer human.

734
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,000
We have these disasters in which, 

735
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,920
in a very short period of time,

736
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,120
a massive amount of destructive power can be brought to bear.

737
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:03,040
The governments doing this must be replaced.

738
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,840
The leaders individually responsible for these actions

739
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,120
must be held to justice.

740
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,960
We’ve seen a wonderful trend in the past twenty years

741
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:17,160
with General Pinochet and a number of others

742
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,720
whose actions led to genocide,  

743
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,200
led to disappearances, led to death,

744
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,480
being brought before world courts of justice. 

745
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,640
So we must move to a world in which every leader 

746
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,480
is held accountable in the same way,

747
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,640
with the feeling that their actions will be judged.

748
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:43,080
As a human being, I feel that, 

749
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,960
what is today’s war?

750
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:49,280
We are killing each other and it’s something that

751
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,200
is taking peace away from a lot of people.

752
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:37,760
Question Fifty-Six from Moise Marabout, 23, Agadez, Niger…

753
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,240
Why is there no peace in the Middle East yet?

754
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,560
This question

755
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,520
is extremely, extremely, extremely, extremely,

756
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,000
extremely close to my heart as an Israeli.

757
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:56,200
I can only say that, the way I see it,

758
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,400
there's no peace in the Middle East

759
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,560
because of the vanity of Israel.

760
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,600
As long as justice is not addressed, 

761
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,880
we will not have peace.

762
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,360
Peace is not a moment between conflicts

763
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,720
but a continuous state one lives and strives for.

764
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,680
The only peace now

765
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,200
is false peace,

766
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,000
peace based upon lack of trust.

767
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,400
Oil.

768
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,840
Well, I believe the main reason is

769
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,320
because of fanatics on both sides.

770
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,200
On both sides.

771
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,360
You can't ignore the fact

772
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,680
that we are deeply scarred as a people,

773
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,680
but instead of trying to heal ourselves

774
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:50,000
by recognizing that we simply must use compassion,

775
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,160
love and forgiveness,

776
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,400
and engage in dialogue eye to eye,

777
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,720
we keep hiding behind our supposed righteousness

778
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,840
but there is no such thing.

779
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,920
And we feel like we're allowed to do anything 

780
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,560
because of what was done to us.

781
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,160
I believe the Palestinian and the Israeli

782
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,920
would like to be able to coexist together.

783
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,480
The whole argument that we were here first 

784
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,080
and they were here first is totally irrelevant.

785
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,360
We are all visitors on this planet.

786
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,840
We are all strangers walking on borrowed land.

787
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,040
Once the Palestinian and the Israeli will live equally 

788
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,200
with self-respect, 

789
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:36,560
with respect to each other and solidarity,

790
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,200
it will echo to the entire world!

791
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,160
It will stop these stupid battles 

792
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,760
that the state decides of the culture

793
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,680
between the West and the Muslims.

794
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,000
It's such a bullshit thing! 

795
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,520
In Israel and Palestine we can prove

796
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,640
that this together can be the most beautiful culture one can have.

797
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,000
I know I sound like a dreamer…

798
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:03,640
In my country, in my community, we normally say…

799
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,800
…which means, ‘Where two bulls fight, 

800
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,200
normally the grass is the one that suffers.’

801
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,200
Question Sixty-One from Wolfgang Jost,

802
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,480
23, Berlin, Germany…

803
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,320
Why is an Iranian nuclear bomb

804
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,320
supposed to be more dangerous than an American, 

805
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,560
Israeli or French?

806
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,720
Let us not ask this question in America or France or in Israel!

807
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:17,000
But let us ask this question in Algeria or in Iraq 

808
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,680
or in Lebanon or in Palestine…

809
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,560
or even Japan!

810
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,160
August 7, 1945: 

811
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:35,040
America dropped a bomb on Hiroshima.

812
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:39,000
Some hundred thousand people have been killed,

813
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,920
children in school, primary school, civilians, 

814
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,760
and the killing went on for years 

815
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,720
because of the atomic consequences.

816
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:58,560
Who has been using really those bombs, practically? 

817
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,840
Until now, just USA.

818
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:06,400
Iran pledges, promises, to destroy Israel.

819
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:11,760
And there is no doubt that if Iran were to have a nuclear bomb,

820
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,160
it would keep its promise.

821
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,920
Israel? 

822
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,080
Israel’s bombs? Where do they come from? 

823
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,280
We make those. 

824
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,440
We sell them to Israel.

825
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:34,040
The American, Israeli, and French bombs should be eliminated.

826
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,000
France and the United States have a legal obligation to do so

827
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,480
under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,

828
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,120
and Israel has a security interest 

829
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,240
in resolving the conflicts in its region through non-violent means. 

830
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,760
Because eventually, as long as some have nuclear weapons, 

831
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,000
others will want them.

832
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,760
As long as they want them, at some point they will get them.

833
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,840
And as long as they exist, it's inevitable

834
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,880
That, either through accident or design, they will be used.

835
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,200
Any use is catastrophic. 

836
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,600
Therefore they must be universally abolished.

837
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,640
Why do we have to have a nuclear bomb?

838
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,040
If we were to start all over again,

839
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,600
no one would say that it was a good idea to build nuclear bombs.

840
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:24,560
Insane!

841
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,240
Who would we be 

842
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,560
if we didn’t live in the shadow of the atomic bomb?

843
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,880
I think we would be very different people.

844
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,120
Would we live in this sense of fear that is manipulated

845
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,960
by external powers so easily?

846
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:51,040
Would we still be allowing the level of violence that we allow?

847
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,760
I don’t think so.

848
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,680
I think we could have found some wonderful ways

849
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,880
to deal with conflict that wasn’t violence.

850
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:07,920
And I do think that who we are in the 21st Century has 

851
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:15,240
deeply been affected by technological advances in weaponry.

852
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,880
And I don’t think we fully understand 

853
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,800
what that’s done to our humanity,

854
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,320
what it’s done 

855
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,640
even just to American citizens to have used the atomic bomb.

856
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,880
I think that contributes to how 

857
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:35,240
violent our own inner nature is. 

858
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:40,640
It has contributed to the level of depression,

859
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,560
the level of addictions, 

860
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,560
the disconnect and denial… 

861
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,720
yeah, I think it would be a very different world, 

862
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,360
a very different world,

863
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,800
certainly one more caring and generous

864
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,160
and compassionate and wise.

865
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,360
Question Sixty-Two is from

866
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,680
the writer and activist Arundhati Roy…

867
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:27,280
Between non-violent resistance and armed struggle, 

868
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,640
where do we go?

869
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,440
What is effective? 

870
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,840
What is the right thing to do?

871
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:38,120
Do we need a biodiversity of resistance?

872
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:45,200
Arundhati, if you could sit here and hear this murmur

873
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,520
and see all these faces…

874
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,600
I like the name ‘biodiversity of resistance’.

875
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,640
This is a great question 

876
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:00,960
and I’m not sure that we are the ones to answer.

877
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:06,680
Yeah, I would prefer to say I prefer a non-violent resistance.

878
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,080
Yeah, I wish this resistance would make it.

879
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,720
But we are not the ones 

880
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,840
to choose the resistance of the oppressed.

881
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:18,440
We certainly need a variety of forms of resistance.

882
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,000
Armed struggle must be the last resort.

883
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:26,480
It must be something that we are very, very mindful of

884
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,160
and oftentimes suspicious of, 

885
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,520
and yet there are conditions under which armed struggle 

886
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,600
becomes necessary.

887
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,320
For the most part, 

888
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,240
we must deploy all forms of non-violent resistance and struggle,

889
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:43,040
understanding non-violence as something active,

890
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:46,600
as something that’s vital and vibrant,

891
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,560
something that requires our sacrifice, our suffering,

892
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:54,360
something that allows us to accent the best in ourselves

893
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,000
and the best in others.

894
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:01,320
The struggle for change 

895
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,560
in every single place where struggle has been successful

896
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,480
has employed what you term a 'biodiversity' of tactics,

897
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,240
from non-violent resistance

898
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,440
to political organizing, to speechmaking

899
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,360
to armed struggle: 

900
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,240
legitimate armed struggle based on  

901
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,520
the principles laid down by, among others,

902
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,760
the African National Congress and Che Guevara,

903
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,720
to distinguish between mere terrorism, 

904
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:32,560
violence for its own sake with unnecessary casualties,

905
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,320
and armed struggle that is undertaken

906
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,640
to mobilize and protect 

907
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,760
an oppressed majority.

908
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,560
As someone who is an organizer, whatever decision I make 

909
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,600
and whatever movement I am engaged with,

910
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:47,320
I always have to ask myself: 

911
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,320
can I live with the impact of the tactic that I am going to use?

912
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,320
It never happens when change is taking place

913
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,120
that it does not affect others.

914
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:01,120
Always, there are victims of change.

915
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:05,400
Ask yourself, how much are you willing to give?

916
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:09,640
How convinced are you of your goal?

917
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,960
And then you can choose the weapons.

918
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,320
It could be a pen, could be a gun,

919
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,760
could be a camera, could be a piece of paper, could be a knife, 

920
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,400
could be your life.

921
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:29,720
I think that we can accomplish a lot with non-violent resistance,

922
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:34,960
but are there times when armed struggles are justified?

923
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,040
Are revolutions justified?

924
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,640
I think, concentrating on resistance, 

925
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,280
there’s something wrong with that.

926
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,040
We’re not just concentrating on resistance.

927
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,520
We have to create attractance.

928
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,960
We have to create a new paradigm,

929
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:56,320
which is attractive to go to.

930
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,360
If everyone is blooming in their own beauty...

931
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,480
Imagine that! 

932
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,400
Everyone sitting here in the circle at the table 

933
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,800
blooming their own beauty. 

934
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:14,320
Yes, Arundhati, we need a biodiversity on Earth.

935
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,760
It’s everyone’s language, everyone’s culture, 

936
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,000
everyone’s spiritual understanding.

937
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,960
At this very moment, you can see around me

938
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,720
a circle that represents a global community

939
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,960
where, clearly, there is diversity,

940
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,880
diversity of thought,

941
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,320
diversity of  ideas,

942
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,800
diversity of concepts.

943
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,680
Is anyone there listening to us?

944
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,080
At some other time?

945
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,720
It might be catapulted into the world

946
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,920
like a discus.

947
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,600
Super.

948
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,200
Yes? Sounds good? That's it? 

949
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,440
Beautiful.

950
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,920
Can you take your head off,

951
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:00,640
so you can really feel what’s going on around you,

952
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,880
you can really sense what’s going on around you?

953
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:06,000
Or are you still in your mind, thinking? 

954
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,720
Our friend the camera.

955
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,880
Guys, 

956
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,800
whatever you hear from me, if there is one smart thing, 

957
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,320
take it and the rest please erase it…

958
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,440
You also went to the center. How was the center? 

959
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,800
It was really good. 

960
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:26,080
It’s amazing because you can click onto the different…

961
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,760
any camera you can go.

962
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,720
Question Seventy-Five 

963
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:09,760
from Sara Francis, 35, Dublin, Ireland…

964
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,960
What does courage mean now?

965
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:18,640
Courage is something I appreciate about a person so much.

966
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:22,240
I mean, people...I salute the people who have courage!

967
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:26,440
Courage is something to make you continue to live day to day life.

968
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,680
Courage is something… 

969
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,720
Step by step, you go up!

970
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,400
It takes courage to be a human being. 

971
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,680
It takes courage to be!

972
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,520
Solitude is courage.

973
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:37,880
Hermetics.

974
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,720
Total neutrality.

975
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,400
To be

976
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,240
unsure of yourself is courage.

977
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,120
Courage is so many things.

978
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:52,120
Courage is the courage of Aung San Suu Kyi,

979
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:59,080
who is being kept incommunicado under house arrest.

980
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,080
Courage is the courage of 

981
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,800
the young students in Tiananmen Square.

982
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,480
We risk our lives in different ways…

983
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,360
well, I’ve never really risked mine so I can’t say.

984
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,560
I’ve never lived in truly dangerous situations

985
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,320
the way so many people around this table have done.

986
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:24,400
To put it quite simply, I am willing to die.

987
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,600
Yes, I’m willing to die. 

988
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,480
I have the courage really to take the risk to die

989
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,160
to defend who I am and what I’m doing.

990
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,840
Well, I mean, we're sitting in a square where

991
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,680
the adventure of Nazism 

992
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:45,240
took over this beautiful country of Germany, 

993
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:47,840
and distorted the laws of justice 

994
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:52,120
in a most gross and horrific fashion.

995
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,120
Imagine the courage of people that broke the laws of the state

996
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,440
to honor the higher law

997
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:03,360
of caring for human life.

998
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,360
You don't know that Chinese prison labor camps

999
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,440
are similar to Soviet gulags

1000
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,720
or German concentration camps.

1001
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,360
About 40 or 50 million people

1002
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,720
have lost their lives there.

1003
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:21,480
I was there for 19 years

1004
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,960
before I made it to America.

1005
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:28,080
I didn’t want to talk about this

1006
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,960
but finally I have

1007
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:34,680
because we have only one lifetime.

1008
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:37,720
What would Argentina have been without the courage

1009
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,920
of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo,

1010
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,840
who stood up to the dictatorships and terrorism

1011
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,240
of the Generals Videla, Massera and Agosti

1012
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,040
who 'disappeared' thousands of people

1013
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,760
by throwing them into the sea.

1014
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,720
What would have become of us

1015
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,680
without the lesson in courage

1016
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,080
taught by these mothers

1017
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,960
who stood before the Casa de Gobierno

1018
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,240
every Thursday

1019
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:02,880
with the portraits of their disappeared sons?

1020
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,280
Courage means to understand

1021
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,120
that these powers are not invincible,

1022
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:12,240
as is being demonstrated by people in the world

1023
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,600
who, with courage and indignation,

1024
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,840
have managed to expel

1025
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,960
transnationals from their countries,

1026
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:25,080
have managed to overthrow and topple governments.

1027
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,560
Courage has everything to do with

1028
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:32,960
looking the future into the face,

1029
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,640
always acknowledging an element of the unknown,

1030
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,680
but believing that if one sacrifices, 

1031
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,680
if one suffers, 

1032
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:48,440
if one takes a risk and allows oneself to be vulnerable, 

1033
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,400
that one can still make a difference.

1034
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:55,400
We should keep this in mind and it should make us

1035
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,480
all the more radical and motivated

1036
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,640
as we don't risk our lives,

1037
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,600
but just a little boredom sometimes,

1038
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,680
a little ostracism,

1039
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,440
a little of our well-being.

1040
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,080
Courage is also not just about changing this world.

1041
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,320
It is really also about ensuring that

1042
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,480
the present day world does not change me.

1043
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:21,800
Question Seventy-Eight from Nancy Clemons, 57, 

1044
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,000
Cameron, Missouri, USA…

1045
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:29,920
What can I do, and tell others to do, to stop global warming? 

1046
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Please begin.

1047
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:46,800
This is a big question!

1048
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,040
Quite simply,

1049
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:52,840
future generations will not be able to understand

1050
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:57,160
our delirium of destruction.

1051
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:02,560
There’s nothing you and I, we, can do to stop the global warming.

1052
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:06,760
The ice is going to carry on melting away.

1053
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:11,800
And now the matter is: who will live?

1054
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,520
Who will live with a life worth living?

1055
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:19,720
We know that many will perish.

1056
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,600
We know that many more will barely survive with no life.

1057
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,960
Few will have a life worthy of living.

1058
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:32,520
I pray to the Great One and ask him again and pray again that

1059
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,920
you and me will be able to have a life worthy of living.

1060
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,400
Because, no matter what you and I do today, 

1061
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:43,000
there’s no way of returning.

1062
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:47,320
The ice will carry on melting until it has ceased to exist.

1063
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:53,000
Actually, we can’t stop global warming any more.

1064
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,040
As an evolution biologist I firmly believe 

1065
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,960
that we cannot stop it any more.

1066
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:01,360
However, we can slow it down. 

1067
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,800
Global warming is not about science. 

1068
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,640
It’s about experience. 

1069
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:09,440
Science will give us the facts. It will give us the data

1070
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,160
and it may move us to act. But, ultimately,

1071
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,040
how we move each other to act is a question

1072
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,960
more of the heart than it is of the head.

1073
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:19,160
Well, I guess we are all part of the problem,

1074
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:23,520
but we all can be part of the solution.

1075
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,520
I could make a contribution if I stop driving my car.

1076
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,680
Transitions to biofuels 

1077
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,040
and even large-scale wind and solar 

1078
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,880
would probably not be able to be sufficient to sustain 

1079
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,120
an industrial system at  the present scale...

1080
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,560
So the answer is powering down.

1081
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,760
Right now, 

1082
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:47,840
hundreds of communities are starting to take these steps.

1083
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:51,560
They are engaged in what is called ‘power down’.

1084
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:54,880
They are looking at how they 

1085
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,800
as communities can take steps right now

1086
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,320
to localize their economies.

1087
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:05,000
They realize that, if oil prices shoot up or if there’s scarcity,

1088
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,920
they may find the supermarket shelves empty.

1089
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,040
They may find that they won't be able to heat their homes,

1090
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,080
that they won't be able to travel… 

1091
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:20,640
We must talk about how to control 

1092
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,720
our cheap desire.

1093
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:28,560
I think something we can all do worldwide 

1094
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:32,880
is to shame and ridicule the people who are polluting. 

1095
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,800
There won't be any state of emergency.

1096
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,200
We have been for thousands of years

1097
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,120
in a state of emergency.

1098
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,240
We delude ourselves into thinking that

1099
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:51,880
these problems are the creation of

1100
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:55,640
our nation, government, religion or race,

1101
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,280
but this is not so.

1102
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,560
The problem lies within

1103
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:03,720
each individual's consciousness.

1104
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,960
I don’t believe in humankind! No, I don’t.

1105
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:13,200
I tell you I’m embarrassed to belong to that race.

1106
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:27,800
And at the same time, I’m fascinated by it. 

1107
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,840
La belle et la bestia.

1108
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:31,000
Question Eighty-Three is 

1109
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:35,240
from the photographer Sebastião Salgado

1110
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:39,200
of Aimorés, Minas Gerais, Brazil…

1111
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:43,920
Can a person be perceptive enough to see our planet 

1112
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:48,080
in a way that tells them that they too are part of nature?

1113
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:53,840
We all start seeing clearer and clearer the damage done.

1114
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,360
We see it at our doorsteps!

1115
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,920
We see and feel the climate changes,

1116
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,600
the droughts and the flooding, 

1117
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,960
the storms and the heat. 

1118
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,320
We breathe the bad air. 

1119
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,000
We suffer from allergies. 

1120
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,600
We miss the taste in food. 

1121
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,280
We watch the forest die,

1122
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:18,560
the animals and plants endangered and disappearing.

1123
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,400
And more and more of us understand

1124
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:27,320
that the planet does not belong to us

1125
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:32,080
but that we belong to the Earth.

1126
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,920
Since the 20th Century,

1127
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:42,680
when man was able to escape gravity and move into space,

1128
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:47,120
we’ve had pictures, beautiful pictures of our planet,

1129
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:52,080
that little blueish globe floating through the universe.

1130
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,680
And, as you look at those pictures, 

1131
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,000
you become almost sentimental and think:

1132
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:59,680
I live on this planet, I am part of this planet.

1133
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,880
Go out in a field and lie down at night

1134
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,760
and look down into the stars.

1135
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,320
Pretend that gravity has you glued to the bottom of the planet

1136
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,920
because how do you know which way is up?

1137
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:16,720
The reason why little children love animals is because

1138
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:20,480
we have co-evolved with the rest of creation.

1139
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:25,880
We have lived close to nature for almost all our evolution.

1140
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,720
This little blip of modern life cut off from the Earth,

1141
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:35,880
cut off from other animals and cut off from one another

1142
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:36,880
has only happened 

1143
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:40,080
because we've also become cut off from ourselves,

1144
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,800
from our own hearts, from our own bodies…

1145
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,840
Nature makes the most sophisticated materials on the planet 

1146
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,160
out of carbohydrates. 

1147
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,680
We too can learn how to do that.

1148
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:55,480
But we have thought ourselves to be superior to nature.

1149
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,600
We haven’t looked at her 

1150
01:16:57,720 --> 01:17:00,400
four and a half billion years of experience 

1151
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,880
in incredible technologies.

1152
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,760
Take a wasps’ nest! It’s a building that hangs from a single thread

1153
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,400
made of material so light that it can hold

1154
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:15,360
three hundred times its own weight in inhabitants.

1155
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:18,720
Can we learn to make buildings like that?

1156
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:21,320
Can we grow skyscrapers from the bottom up

1157
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,160
the way a reed grows,

1158
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:27,880
by building new cells at the bottom of it and pushing itself upward?

1159
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,520
We have so much to learn from nature.

1160
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:35,320
It is by our own free choice,

1161
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:37,800
by our personal efforts,

1162
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:41,400
that we will achieve balance with nature

1163
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,840
and so become like all of nature.

1164
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,520
Then we will feel

1165
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,600
the eternity, perfection and harmony

1166
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:52,440
that is everywhere in nature

1167
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:56,840
except within our own.

1168
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,880
Everything we eat, everything we wear, 

1169
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:04,000
all our houses, all our objects come from the living Earth,

1170
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:10,160
so learning how to live from that Earth in a way that is sustainable

1171
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:12,840
is not utopian, is not a dream.

1172
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:17,200
What stands between us and that possibility

1173
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:20,320
is the idea that it can't be done,

1174
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:23,040
the idea that they are too powerful, 

1175
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,800
that corporations can't change,

1176
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,400
the idea that people don't want change,

1177
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:34,000
the idea that all of this comes from innate human greed,

1178
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:38,400
that it comes from overpopulation. The planet is too crowded,

1179
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:42,040
therefore it's not possible to provide for people.

1180
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:46,560
All of these are myths that need to be reassessed,

1181
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:50,280
assumptions that need to be rethought.

1182
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:43,160
So, Question Ninety-Six comes from Miraj Khaled, 

1183
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,760
30, from Dhaka, Bangladesh…

1184
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,000
‘What is God’s religion?’, he asks.

1185
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:52,200
What is God’s religion? Please begin.

1186
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:57,200
I loved that question when I saw it

1187
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,360
because I think this is very perceptive!

1188
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:01,160
Which God? 

1189
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,440
Which Religion?

1190
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:09,280
What God? Whose God?

1191
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:14,000
Whichever way we want to take it,

1192
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:20,680
we must respect how others see this word ‘God’.

1193
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:24,880
God is a way of defining

1194
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,080
certain archetypes,

1195
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,360
certain expectations and

1196
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,000
objectives.

1197
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,120
God is is-ness.

1198
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,480
God is spirit! God is not religion.

1199
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,200
God doesn’t have a religion.

1200
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,360
God doesn't exist.

1201
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,800
The religion of my Goddess 

1202
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:53,200
is reflected in every corner of the world, 

1203
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:02,600
in every leaf, in every speck of dirt, in every flower.

1204
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,160
No, I don’t believe that God has a religion.

1205
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:13,400
I think that religion is a profoundly human phenomenon.

1206
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,760
And when we talk about God having a religion,

1207
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,080
you can rest assured 

1208
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,040
that we’re talking about some human construction,

1209
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:21,960
some human creation…

1210
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,840
What we project onto Him.

1211
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,840
I am of Love.

1212
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,760
I am of the Universe.

1213
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,120
I am God in Action.

1214
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,240
There is no God.

1215
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,560
God is a symbol

1216
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:42,080
for something that we can't express in words

1217
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:45,960
and that's also why there's no God's religion.

1218
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:49,960
God, we have to imagine, is something

1219
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:53,680
that is not only unknown to us

1220
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:56,360
but is also beyond our knowledge,

1221
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:59,800
that has no quality of being known.

1222
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:03,440
It's like when we ask the question,

1223
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,880
what is the color of a circle?

1224
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:11,280
Is it red, green or blue?

1225
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,800
No, it's neither blue nor red nor green.

1226
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,240
It's also not colorless.

1227
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:21,480
The question about the color of the circle is absurd

1228
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,520
because a circle knows no color.

1229
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,760
Many people are unwilling to see this.

1230
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:30,240
They take a pen out of their pocket,

1231
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,440
draw a circle on a piece of paper

1232
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,400
and say, 'Look, this circle is blue.'

1233
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:39,840
Yes, the circle drawn by them is blue

1234
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,960
but the color comes from a pen

1235
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,480
and not from the circle.

1236
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:49,080
The color of the pen is the religion

1237
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:52,320
with which we express the divinity,

1238
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:55,840
but we cannot draw the circle ourselves.

1239
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,160
It is something that has nothing to do with colors

1240
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,280
and there are as many religions

1241
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:05,200
as there are colors with which I can draw a circle.

1242
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,520
I really like that one!

1243
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:14,520
I'm someone that believes in God, but all I know about God is,

1244
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,640
there is a God and it isn't me.

1245
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:18,440
That's all I've been able to figure out so far.

1246
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,360
Don’t you think God is in you as well? 

1247
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:23,520
Oh absolutely. Absolutely. 

1248
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:26,520
Most of my whole thing with spirituality is

1249
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:28,720
I'm a recovering heroin addict.

1250
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:32,320
I haven’t met God yet.

1251
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:36,360
If I meet Him one day, 

1252
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,760
then I will ask Him the questions.

1253
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,760
Thank you.

1254
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:27,800
Thank you, too.

1255
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:29,520
Last one!

1256
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,120
Question…

1257
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,440
One Hundred!

1258
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,200
I didn't think we'd make it!

1259
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:07,160
…from Keith Dierkx, 48, Piedmont, California, USA…

1260
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,080
What are the myths that we need to create 

1261
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,880
to change the world for the better?

1262
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:18,040
Creation stories are part of every culture in human history

1263
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:21,320
and they were usually told by some kind of a priesthood.

1264
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,960
But now science tells the creation story.

1265
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:27,720
It has been elevated to that status of priesthood 

1266
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,840
that gets to tell the big story to the culture.

1267
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,320
What story is it telling us?

1268
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:36,640
That we live in a non-living, purposeless universe

1269
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,040
running down by entropy.

1270
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:42,480
Oh! How cheery is that for a creation story!

1271
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,960
And then we add in that evolution on this planet

1272
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:49,400
is about the survival of the fittest,

1273
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,040
about an endless competition in scarcity,

1274
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:55,600
and that you have to get what you can while you can 

1275
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,600
and beat the other guy to it.

1276
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:01,760
Now, this is a totally depressing creation story,

1277
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,080
a universe running down meaninglessly,

1278
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:05,640
you’re caught in it,

1279
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,120
you’re stuck in an endless struggle in scarcity.

1280
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:10,840
This is a terrible story to be telling people

1281
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,720
and it does not fit the scientific facts!

1282
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,640
We know that every force in nature has an opposite.

1283
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,640
If there’s entropy, there has to be syntropy.

1284
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,080
We know that in evolution 

1285
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,160
there’s a tremendous amount of cooperation.

1286
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:27,480
In fact, I’d say there’s a great story

1287
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:31,080
in the maturation cycle of evolving species 

1288
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:33,480
where they first are young and grabby

1289
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,880
and multiply as fast as they can, take all the territory they can,

1290
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,400
bump off their competitors, act like capitalists! 

1291
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:45,080
And then they discover, bit by bit, the advantages of cooperation.

1292
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,280
And, as they do so, 

1293
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:50,840
they build bigger and bigger cooperative enterprises

1294
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:53,400
and find out that their economies are cheaper, 

1295
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,640
more effective, more efficient, work for everybody 

1296
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,040
and you get the evolution of rainforests

1297
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:02,480
and human bodies made of a hundred trillion cells,

1298
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:04,480
working in complete cooperation 

1299
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,800
even though they’re so very diverse.

1300
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,400
This is a story we need to tell in the world,

1301
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,040
a great new story 

1302
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:15,080
of the human species growing up into global family,

1303
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,160
doing win-win economics and 

1304
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,600
making a better world for all.

1305
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:24,040
Human beings are appreciators, 

1306
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:28,760
not just observers but appreciators, participants, 

1307
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,720
even co-creators of the cosmic process.

1308
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:37,720
The whole world is deeply entangled,

1309
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:40,600
all the living organisms, 

1310
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,840
all the parts of the universe.

1311
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,760
In fact, the whole universe is living, 

1312
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,680
including the electrons and the protons and everything. 

1313
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,760
They are all organisms! 

1314
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:53,920
They all have a history and they are all entangled 

1315
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:56,560
so deeply, intimately interconnected 

1316
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:59,960
that you cannot separate them.

1317
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:04,640
And, at any moment, this entangled universe

1318
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:07,640
is creating and recreating itself anew.

1319
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:11,640
That I think is the evolution of the cosmos,

1320
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:17,360
the evolution of all things in it from atoms to humans to galaxies.

1321
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:21,320
That is the objective. That is the ambition.

1322
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:25,000
That is the ultimate aim of divine creativity.

1323
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:28,920
That’s as far as we can come as human beings to understand it.

1324
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:33,360
I believe

1325
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:38,560
in a measure of humility

1326
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,200
and in a measure of humanity

1327
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,960
and in an avowal of beauty

1328
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:48,960
as an antidote to all the brutality

1329
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,640
and cruelty of the world.

1330
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:53,920
I believe

1331
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,480
that the sacred lives in nature,

1332
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:58,760
not only in the supernatural

1333
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,280
but also in the beauty of nature.

1334
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,520
I believe

1335
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,120
that human beings are metaphysical animals

1336
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,520
and always will be because of their mortality.

1337
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:11,840
The human is the only animal that knows it must die.

1338
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:14,160
This is the source of the mystery,

1339
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,640
of the unending mystery of human existence.

1340
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:23,440
It would have to do with the marrying of the mind,

1341
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,000
the soul,

1342
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:31,120
and this corporeal little covering that is supposed to be the body. 

1343
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:35,680
The marriage of all those, 

1344
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:39,000
if it indeed be that, 

1345
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,280
can only be powered by positivity.

1346
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:48,600
And if the positivity then manages to give birth to that marriage…?

1347
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:52,240
That all the troubles of the Earth will be done 

1348
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:54,920
if the human mind has got the space in which 

1349
01:29:55,040 --> 01:30:00,120
to breathe, to live, to pulse, to flow…

1350
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:24,640
Who is going to ever listen to all of this?

1351
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:27,320
Because we’re one hundred and twelve, 

1352
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,440
there’s a hundred questions.

1353
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:34,760
That’s eleven thousand two hundred. Let’s say…

1354
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:38,760
Only two minutes each time. That’s twenty-two thousand minutes.

1355
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,520
You know what that is?

1356
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:44,080
That’s three hundred days!
